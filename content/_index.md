## Sunday Sitting Information

We meet on the first Sunday of each month at the Lexington Friends (Quakers) Meetinghouse.  Meditation begins at 2pm and will consist of two 25-minute sitting periods separated by a meditation walk about five minutes in length.  For members who live at a distance, virtual participation through Zoom is supported.  (**Note**:  Sometimes the monthly in-person meeting must be cancelled, so if you are new please <a href="/about/contact">inquire</a> before showing up.)

On all other Sundays the meeting is entirely on Zoom.  You can <a href="/about/contact">contact us</a> to get acquainted and to get our Zoom meeting link.

### Getting to the Friends Meetinghouse (Please Read Carefully!)

The Friends Meetinghouse is located at 649 Price Avenue, Lexington, KY 40508.  The parking lot is quite large, and you must use it, as residents often depend on the street for their parking.  In addition the Friends request, in order to minimize traffic in this quiet neighborhood, that the Meetinghouse be approached only from North Broadway Street.  On Broadway, look for the intersection with Delcamp, which is north of 6th Street and south of Loudon.  There is a traffic light at this intersection.  If you are headed north on Broadway you would turn left onto Delcamp; if headed south you would turn right.  Proceed about 200 yards down Delcamp to the intersection with Price Avenue:  the Friends parking lot is at this intersection.  If you are a regular participant, try to arrive at least 5 minutes early.  If you are new, try to arrive at least 15 minutes early so we can greet you and help you get set up.  In any event, donâ€™t arrive late, as we may need to lock the front door during our sittings and unfortunately we would not be able to hear you knocking.
