## The Evening Bell Chant

This is done by one person, at the beginning of practice.

<blockquote>

## The Heart Sutra

We chant this together.

<blockquote>
The Maha Prajna Paramita Hrdaya Sutra<br>

Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva<br>
when practicing deeply the Prajna Paramita<br>
perceives that all five skandhas are empty<br>
and is saved from all suffering and distress.<br><br>
 
Shariputra,<br>
form does not differ from emptiness,<br>
emptiness does not differ from form.<br>
That which is form is emptiness,<br>
that which is emptiness form.<br>
The same is true of feelings,<br>
perceptions, impulses, consciousness.<br><br>
 
Shariputra,<br>
all dharmas are marked with emptiness;<br>
they do not appear or disappear,<br>
are not tainted or pure,<br>
do not increase or decrease.<br><br>
 
Therefore, in emptiness no form, no feelings,<br>
perceptions, impulses, consciousness.<br>
No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind;<br>
no color, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch,<br>
no object of mind;<br>
no realm of eyes and so forth<br>
until no realm of mind consciousness.<br><br>
 
No ignorance and also no extinction of it,<br>
and so forth until no old age and death<br>
and also no extinction of them.<br><br>
 
No suffering, no origination,<br>
no stopping, no path, no cognition,<br>
also no attainment with nothing to attain.<br><br>
 
The Bodhisattva depends on Prajna Paramita<br>
and the mind is no hindrance;<br>
without any hindrance no fears exist.<br>
Far apart from every perverted<br>
view one dwells in Nirvana.<br><br>
 
In the three worlds<br>
all Buddhas depend on Prajna Paramita<br>
and attain Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi.<br><br>
 
Therefore know that Prajna Paramita<br>
is the great transcendent mantra,<br>
is the great bright mantra,<br> 
is the utmost mantra,<br> 
is the supreme mantra, <br>
which is able to relieve all suffering<br>
and is true, not false.<br><br>
 
So proclaim the Prajna Paramita mantra,<br>
proclaim the mantra which says:<br><br>
 
<strong>gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha;<br> 
gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha;<br> 
gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha.</strong>

## The Bodhisattva Vows

We chant the vows together, at the end of practice.

<blockquote>
Sentient beings are numberless:  vowing to save them.<br>
Greed, hatred and ignorance rise endlessly: vowing to abandon them.<br>
Dharma-gates are countless:  vowing to awake to them.<br>
The Buddha-Way is uncontrived:  vowing to embody it fully.<br>
</blockquote>
